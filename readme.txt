"Woo Coupon Duplicator" is more of a task runner

== Description ==
"Woo Coupon Duplicator" helps generate and send coupons when a particular action happens. It has a nice separated logic that allows multiple actions to happen. The default case added is hooking up to an event triggered by Mailchimp - on a successful form submit, a coupon is generated and send to a customer.
